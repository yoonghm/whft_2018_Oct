# Tutorial 1.4

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 4 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

Minimum rotor diameter:

Assume wind speed, V = 12m/s, air density, ρ = 1.23kg, π = 3.14, coefficient Cρ = 0.593 

4MW = 0.5 X 0.593 X 1.23 x 12 x 3.14 x r2

8MW = 1260.38 x 3.14 x r2 

8MW = 3957.59 X r2

r2 = 2021.4 

r = 44.96m

Minimum rotor hub height

Assume Zo = 1

Vh =  Vref x [ln(h/Zo) / ln(href/Zo)]

12 = 10 x [ln (h) / ln (10)

1.2 = ln (h) / 2.3

h = 15.79m
