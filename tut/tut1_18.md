# Tutorial 1.18

You are asked to design a 2 MW, 80 m rotor diameter horizontal axis wind turbine. 
What is the minimum wind speed for the wind turbine to achieve this rated output power?

State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
Assume air density = 1.155kg/m³
Area = π(40)² = 5026.5482m²
Power = 0.5 x air density x velocity³ x area
2000000 = 0.5 x 1.155 x velocity³ x 5026.5482
velocity = ∛	(2000000/(0.5 x 1.155 x 5026.5482))
minimum wind speed = 8.832209
                   = 8.32 m/s
