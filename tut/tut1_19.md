# Tutorial 1.19

You are asked to design a 2 MW, 85 m rotor diameter horizontal axis wind turbine. 
What is the minimum wind speed for the wind turbine to achieve this rated output power?

State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
Cp = 0.593 (Ideal), p = 1.165, A = (PI)((R)(R))

P = (0.5)(Cp)(p)((V)(V)(V))(A)
2000000W = (0.5)(0.593)(1.165)((V)(V)(V))(PI(42.5)(42.5))
2000000W = (1960.1)((V)(V)(V))
(V)(V)(V) = 2000000/1960.1
V = cbrt(2000000/1960.1)
V = cbrt(1020.356)
V = 10.06 m/s
