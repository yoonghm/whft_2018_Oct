# Tutorial 1.5

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 5 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

- Assume air density = 1.155kg/m³
- Assume roughness length = 1.0m 
- Assume rated wind speed = 12m/s
- Assume wind speed at reference height = 4m/s
- Assume reference height = 10m
- Ans: 
- Part 1:
  - 5MW = 0.5 x 1.155 x 12³ x A
  - A = 5010m² 
  - A = π x (d/2)²
  - 5010m² = π x (d/2)²
  - d/2 = √((5010/π))
  - d = 39.935 x 2
  - d = 79.87m
- #Part 2:

- 12m/s = 4m/s x (ln(h))/(ln(10))
- ln(h) = 12/4 x ln(10)
- ln(h) = 6.91
- h = e^6.91
- h = 1000m
- h = 1km
