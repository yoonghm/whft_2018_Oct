# Tutorial 1.7

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 7 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
2. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
P = 0.5 X 0.593 X ρ X v³ X A [W]
λ = ωR/v
A = πr²
**Assuming**
wind speed= 13.5 m/s
Air density =1.225 kg/m³

7 X 10⁶ = 0.5 X 0.593 X 1.225 X (13.5)³ X A
A = 7833.118 m²
7833.118 = π x r²
r² = 2493.35 m
r = 50m
therefore, minimum rotor diameter = 50 + 50 = 100m
Because rotor hub height with large rotor diameter needs to be taller and if there are buildings around the area, the height has to be taller.
therefore, the minimum rotor hub height has to be more than 100m, around 150-180m
