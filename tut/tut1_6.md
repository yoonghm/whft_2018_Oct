# Tutorial 1.6

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 6 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
P = 1/2 * Cp *  rho * pi * V3 * R2

Assume V= 15m/s, Cp=0.593, rho=1.196kg/m3,

6MW=1/2 * .593 * 1.196 * 3.14 * (12*12*12) * R*R

12MW = 3848* R*R

R=55.8m

The minimum rotor diameter must be 55.8m

Assume Zo= 1

Vh = VRef * (ln(h/Zo))/(ln(href/Zo))

12 = 10 * (ln(h/1))/(ln(10/1))

4.69 = ln(h)

108.9 = h

h = 108.9m

The minimum rotor hub height is 108.9m
