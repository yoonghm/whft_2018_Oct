# Tutorial 1.1

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 2 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

Assuming V= 11m/s, Cp=1.225, rho=1.225kg/m3

2*10^6 W = 1/2 * 16/27 * 1.225 * (11*11*11) * A

A = 4139.8979

R = √(4139.8979)/ π

R = 36.3m

Ans: Minimum rotor diameter is 36.6m

Assuming Zo=1, h(ref)= 10m, V(ref)= 10m/s, Vh= 20m/s

20 = 10 * ((ln(h/1))/(ln(10/1))

h = 100m

Ans: Minimum rotor hub height is 100m
