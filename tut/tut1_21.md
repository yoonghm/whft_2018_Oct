# Tutorial 1.21

You are asked to design a 3 MW, 90 m rotor diameter horizontal axis wind turbine. 
What is the minimum wind speed for the wind turbine to achieve this rated output power?

State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
Assume air density = 1.225kg/m³
Rotor radius = 90 ÷ 2 
             = 45m
Cross sectional area, A = πr²
                        = π(45²)
                        = 6361.725m²
Since P = 1/2 X p X V³ X A
for P = wind power
    p = air density
    V = wind speed
    A = cross sectional area
3000000 = 1/2 X (1.225) X V³ X (6361.725)
V = 27.747
  = 27.7m/s
