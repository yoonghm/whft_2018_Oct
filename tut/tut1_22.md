# Tutorial 1.22

You are asked to design a 5 MW, 120 m rotor diameter horizontal axis wind turbine. 
What is the minimum wind speed for the wind turbine to achieve this rated output power?

State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

 assume air density is  1.155
 
 Area = PI x 60 x 60
      = 11309.73
      
 P = 1/2 x 1.155 x v^3 x 11309.73
 
 v^3 = 5 000 000 / (1/2) / 1.155 / 11309.73 
 
 v = 9.15m/s
