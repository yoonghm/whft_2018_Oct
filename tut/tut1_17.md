# Tutorial 1.17

A horizontal axis wind turbine has the following specifications:

1. Rotor radius is 73 m
1. Rated output is 6 MW at 13.5 m/s wind speed

Determine its power output efficiency at 13.5 m/s.  State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
<pre>
Assume air density = 1.225 kg/m<sup>3</sup>
Cross-sectional area = πr² 
                     = 16741.55 m²                  
Power = 0.5 x 1.225 x 13.5<sup>3</sup> x 16741.55
      = 25229175.79 W
      = 25.22917579 MW
Efficiency = ( 6 / 25.22917579 )x 100% 
           = 23.782%
</pre>
## The power output efficiency at 13.5 m/s is 23.782%.
