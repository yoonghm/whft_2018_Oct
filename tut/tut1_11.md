# Tutorial 1.11

A horizontal axis wind turbine has the following specifications:

1. Rotor radius is 48 m
1. Rated output is 2 MW at 13 m/s wind speed

Determine its power output efficiency at 13 m/s.  State all assumption.

## Assuming air density: 1.225 kg/m^3
Power output : 1/2×16/27×1.225kg/m^3×〖(13m/s)〗^3  ×(π〖48〗^2) = 5.771MW
