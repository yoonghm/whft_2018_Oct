# Tutorial 1.12

A horizontal axis wind turbine has the following specifications:

1. Rotor radius is 48 m  
1. Rated output is 2 MW at 13.5 m/s wind speed

Determine its power output efficiency at 13.5 m/s.  State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

if rotor radius is 48m, cross-sectional area, A = PI * r^2
                                                = PI * 48^2
                                                = 7238.22947
                                                
P = (1/2) * p * v^3 * A
  = (1/2) * 1.225 * 13.5^3 * 7238.22947
  = 10907864.8

power efficiency = (2000000/10907864.8) * 100
                 = 18.34%
