# Tutorial 1.16

A horizontal axis wind turbine has the following specifications:

1. Rotor radius is 68 m
1. Rated output is 5 MW at 13.5 m/s wind speed

Determine its power output efficiency at 13.5 m/s.  State all assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
- Assume air density = 1.155kg/m³
- Diameter = 68m X 2
         = 136m
- Wind speed = 13.5 m/s
- Area = π(68m)²
     = 14526.724m²
- Power = 0.5(1.155) X (14526.724) X (13.5)³
             = 20640536.39W
             = 20.641MW
- Efficiency = 5/20.641 X 100
             = 24.223%
