# Tutorial 1.8

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 8 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

1. P= 1/2 * 0.593 * p * v^3 *A W

 Assuming :  Cp= 16/27 =0.593, V=10 m/s , rho=1.225 
  λ = ωR/v
  A = πr²

  8 * 10^6 W = 1/2* 0.593 * 1.225 * (10^3) * A 
  A = 8 * 10^6 / 1/2* 0.593 * 1.225 * (10^3)
  A = 9177.36 m²
  9177.36 =π * r² 
  r² = 2921.244
  r= 54.04m 
  
  Minimum roter diameter = 54.04 + 54.04 = 108.09m 

2. The minimum roter hub is more than 108.09m.
