### A. Illustrate and explain the equivalenet circuit of a **synchronous machine**<img src="http://www.eeeguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Circuit-Model-of-Synchronous-Machine-9.jpg" width="700" height="300">
A synchronous machine is just an electromechanical transducer which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice versa.The fundamental phenomenon or law which makes these conversions possible are known as the **Law of Electromagnetic Induction** and **Law of Interaction**.

### B. Using the equivalent circuit, explain how its output ((terminal) voltage is affected by the active and reactive power drawn by its connected load.
If the active power and reactive power drawn by the connected load increases, the terminal voltage increases. As P = VI, active power directly proportional to the voltage levels as well.

### C. How is the terminal voltage maintained at various loading level?
#### 1. Reactive Compensation
Through reactive compensation, depending on the load, the reactive power will increase or decrease which help to regulate terminal voltage and power factor. Thus, with a heavier load, power factor will increase. Think of it this way. As a car goes through bumps in the road the suspension of a car will reduce the shock and bumps on the car. This is almost similar to the voltage spikes as it does not spike at various level when suddenly there is a large amount of load.

#### 2. Switching loads around on the grid
Not every part of the grid is used at once, so by rerouting heavier loads during peak periods to parts that are not as electrically stressed, the voltage level would be kept more consistent. This can be done by opening and closing breakers located in electrical substations which create alternate paths to provide power.

#### 3.Ensuring that switching surges are controlled
Many types of equipment, such as large motors, cause a surge of current when switched on which can cause a change in voltage level. Capacitors and resistors can help to dampen the inrush current which helps keeps the voltage level consistent

### D. How is its output frequency maintained at 50 or 60 Hz?
In case, when the synchronous machine is operating as a generator, it has to run at a fixed speed called Synchronous speed to generate the power at a particular frequency. By controlling the synchronous speed, the frequency of the power produced can be regulated which in some countries, the value of the frequency is 50 or 60 hertz
