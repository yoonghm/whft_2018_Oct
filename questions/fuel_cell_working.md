## How does a fuel cell work?  
   = Illustrate the working principles of a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC)
   
   First of all, fuel cell is a conversion of energy which is device that is able to produce electricity and heat by combining a fuel and an oxidant. Typically hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as the oxidant.
Fuel cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy directly without having the process of combustion to occur. This gives a much higher conversion efficiency compared to a typical combustion engine.

Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) contains proton conducting polymer membrane which acts as an electrolyte. The polymer membrane is thin, flexible and transparent.
It is coated on either side with porous carbon support material.

Advantages of fuel cell are that fuel cells are long lasting and highly reliable since there are no physical moving parts involved in the production of electricity. Fuel cells are silent as there is a lack of moving parts.
Disadvantages of fuel cell is that the cost of implementing is very high. This cause fuel cell technology currently only economically competitive in a few highly specialised applications. E.g. onboard space shuttles. Fuel cells is hard to have hydrogen gas stored and not popular even though it works best with hydrogen gas.


   - Explain the oxidation and reduction processes of a PEMFC
   
   Oxidation processes of a PEMFC is when electrons are removed from a species and electrons are set free by the reaction.
Reduction is a process where the electrons are added to a species and electrons are being consumed by the reaction.
   
   
   - Illustrate and compare various type of fuel cells (use PEMFC, PAFC, AFC, SOFC and MCFC)
   
   Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC)
   - It uses a proton-conducting polymer membrane as the electrolyte and the membrane is made from perfluorinated sulphoric acid
     polymer.
   
   Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)
   - It employs a solid ceramic electrolyte. Yttria-stabilised zirconia (YSZ) is the most popular oxygen ion conductor for SOFC.
     The Anode electrode material is nickel-YSZ. Nickel provides a very strong conductivity.
     
   Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC)
   - Its anode electrolyte usually consists of nickel/chronium alloy while the cathode electrode consists of lithiated nicel oxide.
     Nickel provides catalytic activity and electrical conductivity.
   
   Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC)
   - Its electrolyte contains a thin silicon carbide matrix between 2 porous graphite electrodes coated with a platinum catalyst.
   
   Alkali Fuel Cell (AFC)
   - Its electrolyte in the AFC is an aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) and metal (nickel) that can be used as a catalyst at the anode
     and the cathode.
     
   Comparing all fuel cells together I can tell that most of the fuel cell's electrolytes uses Nickel as it is a good conductor of
   electricity.
