## How much energy could we harvest from the wind?  
   - How does wind work?
   - Illustrate and explain various means to record wind speeds and directions.  
   - How do we visualize wind data?  
   - How do we estimate wind speeds at higher altitude?  Give examples  
   - What are the wind resources in Singapore, in South-east Asia?

1. Wind is air moving between regions of different pressure. It is produced by the uneven heating of the earth's surface by the sun and moves from higher to lower pressure. Due to the rotation of the Earth, the direction of the wind is affected.

2. Wind speed can be measured using a device called anemometer. It has four cups attached to measure the wind speed accurately. Wind direction can be measure using a wind vane. It work by moving to minimize wind resistance. Therefore it can show the direction of the wind by moving along with it.

3. We can use graphs to see the trend of the wind and the measurements whether there is a change in direction or wind speed. We can also use thermal imaging from satellite to see various temperature of certain area to indicate wind directions. 

4. We can use formula to theoratically estimate wind speed at higher altitude. Another way is by doing vertical extrapolation of the measured wind speed. 

5. In Singapore, there are limited renewable energy options. There are no hydro resources, our wind speeds and mean tidal range are low. Thailand is the largest wind energy producer in the region with a total installed capacity of 530MW.
