# How much energy could we harvest from the wind?  

## 1 How does wind work?
#### Wind is air in motion, where it's movement is dependent on pressure and temeperature. Air would always move from an area of              high temperature and/or pressure to an area with low temp and/or pressure. 
   
## 2 Illustrate and explain various means to record wind speeds and directions.     
#### Wind speed is typically measured with an anemometer, whereas wind direction is measured with a wind vane, 


      
## 3 How do we visualize wind data?  (needs to be more spcific)
#### It depends on what is the purpose of the visualisation- I personally find this question too broad to answer.
#### Wind data can be measured in
####  – Meter per second [m/s]
####  – Kilometers per hour [km/h]
####  – Nautical mile per hour [knot]
####  – Miles per hour [mph]
####  – Feet per second [fps]
####  – Beaufort scale


## 4 How do we estimate wind speeds at higher altitude?  Give examples
#### It can be done based on the topology terrain and wind speed at a certain height, with the following formula:
####  Vh=Vref x [ln(h/Zo)]/[ln(href/Zo)]
####  Where
| Vh   | Wind speed at desired height |
| --- | --- |
| Vref | Wind speed at 10m from ground |
| h | Desired height of wind that is to be measured |
| href | 10m |
| Zo | Roghness length that is dependent on topology terrain |


## 5 What are the wind resources in Singapore, in South-east Asia?
#### As in where does wind come from, or who are the lergest users of wind energy?
