## How does a hydropower station maintain its output voltage at different output powers? 
   - Illustrate and explain power conversion topology of a typical hydropower plant
   - What is the typical electricity output (AC or DC)?
   - How does it maintain its output voltage at different output powers (active and reactive)?

Answer: The power conversion of a typical hydropower plant occurs when the hydro plant harnesses the energy found in moving or still water and converts it into electricity. This means that as water flows through the hydropower plant, it produces Kinetic energy. The kinetic able to be converted into mechanical energy and then the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.

Answer: DC	

Answer: A vector control for induction machine, controls the current and voltage to wound rotor induction generator such that it ÔÅÆ generates electrical power for a wide range of rotor rotation speed
