## How does a hydropower station maintain its output voltage at different output powers? 
   - Illustrate and explain power conversion topology of a typical hydropower plant
   - What is the typical electricity output (AC or DC)?
   - How does it maintain its output voltage at different output powers (active and reactive)?

Answer:
1. Micro-hydropower is typically rated from 5 KW to 100KW. Amount of power generated depends on the amount of water that is falling and how far the water falls. 
2. The typical electricity output is AC.
3. Transformers are used to maintain the constant voltage of the generator and to match the grid requirement.
